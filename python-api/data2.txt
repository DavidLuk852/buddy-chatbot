BUniPort
.   Students are randomly assigned to the morning or afternoon session in the first semester.   In the second semester, the two groups of students of the same year will swap their timeslots for course add/drop.

                                                Course enrolment record and class timetable

BUniPort
 for the updated course enrolment record and class timetable before attending classes (click "My Enrolment Records & Class Timetable").

                                                Course Add/Drop via BUniPort
                    
Online course add/drop period is scheduled for 
1
 to 13 September
 (except for 7 September).
 
From 10:00 a.m. of 5 September to 13 September, the "Course Add/Drop" function will be available to all students (with the exception of 3:30 a.m. - 5:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. each day, and the whole day of 7 September)

Or you may access the add/drop function via the 
BUniPort

                                                Assigned timeslot for course add/drop
                    
Adding/dropping courses is on a first-come-first-served basis. To avoid system overload, each student is assigned a timeslot
*
 
for adding/dropping courses according to their study year as follows:
 
1 September  -  Year 4 and above
2 September  -  Year 3
3 September  -  Year 2

BUniPort

Dropping of elective courses can be done via the BUniPort and course instructor's approval is not required. In case you need to drop major required courses, please follow the procedures

If a course instructor only agrees to increase the course quota without specifying a particular student, the added quota will be made available to all students on a first-come-frist-served basis.

                                                Adding courses which require Course Instructor's approval
                    
Application procedures are available 
here

Successful enrolment on the course after obtaining approval is subject to fulfillment of all registration requirements, e.g. pre-requisite requirement and availability of class quota, etc.

                Appeal Procedures
            

                                                Student Enquiries and Appeals Regarding Academic Matters
                    
Students may address queries on academic matters to the Academic Registrar, the Dean of the Faculty/School, the Department Head/Programme Director, or any member of the teaching staff as relevant.  
The usual channel is for students to consult the course instructor when the query is about work in a particular course on a programme, the Department Head/Programme Director when the matter is related to the programme as a whole, and the Academic Registrar when the query concerns academic policies and procedures.  
If the query has the potential to become a matter for appeal, students should submit their official enquiries in writing to the Academic Registry.  
 

                                                Student Appeals against Course-Based Assessment
                    
A student who wishes to appeal against course-based assessment including examination grades should first appeal in writing to the course instructor and Department Head/Programme Director concerned within 
3 weeks
 after students are notified of the course semester grades.
The course instructor, or a review panel as decided by the Department Head/Programme Director, shall review the case and report to the Department Head/Programme Director, giving explanations.  The student should be informed of the decision within 
6 weeks
 from the day he/she lodges an appeal.  Any changes in grades should be reported to the Academic Registry at the same time.
If the student is not satisfied with the decision of the reassessment, he/she may appeal in writing to the Academic Registrar within 
2 
weeks
 after receiving the decision from the Programme, giving full reasons in support of the appeal.  A fee will be charged for the appeal.
The Academic Registrar shall review the case and determine if there are grounds for re-consideration:  

• If the Academic Registrar considers that there are insufficient grounds for the appeal, the appeal will be refused and the decision is final.

• If the appeal is accepted, the Academic Registrar shall reconsider the case in consultation with the course instructor and the Department Head/Programme Director to make a final decision.  If deemed appropriate, the Academic Registrar may convene an Appeal Panel to review the case to make a final decision.

                                                Student Appeals against Academic Decisions (Repeat a Year of Study and Dismissal)
                    
Upon the recommendation of the Department Head/Programme Director, the Senate may require students with poor academic results to repeat a year of study or be dismissed from the University.
Students who wish to appeal against such academic decisions should lodge a formal appeal by writing to the Academic Registrar via their department/programme before the deadline set for the completion of clearance procedures, giving full reasons and providing documentations in support of the appeal. A fee will be charged for the appeal. 
The Department Head/Programme Director should submit a recommendation to support, or otherwise, the students' appeals to the Academic Registrar, who will then determine whether the appeals should be dismissed, or submitted for review and final decision by an Appeal Panel.
Any recommendation of the Appeal Panel to revoke Senate decision shall be subject to ratification by the Senate.
The Composition of the Appeal Panel shall be as follows: 

	 
	
•
Chairperson of the Appeal Panel — Chairperson of the Undergraduate Regulations Committee;
 
or in the absence of the Chairperson,  a senior academic nominated by the Academic Registrar;
•
One senior academic nominated by the Chairperson; 
•
The Academic Registrar.

Grade Point Average (GPA)
The GPA is obtained by adding all the grade points gained and then dividing the result by the total number of units attempted.  When calculated for a given semester, it is known as the semester GPA.  When calculated cumulatively for all courses attempted, it is known as the cumulative GPA (cGPA).  
For graduation, a student must pass all courses required by his/her programme of study and attain a minimum 
cumulative GPA of 2.00
. 
 
Notes on Calculation of Semester GPA and Cumulative GPA
 
The units attempted are 
NOT
 included in GPA calculation if the grade for the course is DT, S, U, I, NR, YR or PR.  The grade "E" for the first semester component of a year course will be converted to grade "D" if the student obtains a passing grade for the course in the second semester.
University Life is 
NOT
 included in GPA calculation.  The course codes for University Life are ULIF1008-9 (applicable to students in bulletin year 2018 or before).
The units for course with grade "F" are included in GPA calculation even though there is no grade point earned for the course.
For students admitted in 2016-17 or before, all courses repeated or taken for points are counted in the GPA calculation in the same way as new courses.  The previous course grade would 
NOT
 be replaced by the grade obtained in the subsequent attempt(s).  The number of units gained will only be counted once for the same or equivalent courses.

For graduation, a student must pass all courses required by his/her programme of study and attain a minimum cumulative 
GPA of 2.00

Notes on Calculation of Semester GPA and Cumulative GPA
The units attempted are 
NOT
 included in GPA calculation if the grade for the course is DT, S, U, I, NR, YR or PR.  The grade "E" for the first semester component of a year course will be converted to grade "D" if the student obtains a passing grade for the course in the second semester.
University Life is 
NOT
 included in GPA calculation. The course codes for University Life are: 

	- 
ULIF1005
 (applicable to students in bulletin year 2019 or after) and 

	- 
ULIF1008-9
 (applicable to students in bulletin year 2018 and before).
The units for course with grade "F" are included in GPA calculation even though there is no grade point earned for the course.
For students admitted in 2017-18 or after, students may repeat courses with grade F, for a maximum of 
2 times
, to retrieve the failure.  For a course taken for more than once, only the 
highest grade
*
 will be included in the calculation of cumulative GPA with effect from the semester in which the highest grade is attained.  The number of units gained for the repeated course will be counted once only.  The repeated course must have the same course code of the failed course taken before in order to retrieve the failure. 
* If the grades attained at different attempts are the same, it is the latest grade that is included in the cGPA calculation

Dismissal

                Dismissal
            
The University may at any time, by action of the Senate, require any student to terminate his/her study at the University either on academic or disciplinary grounds, or on other grounds deemed appropriate.

The Senate may also dismiss a student whose conduct or general influence is considered harmful to the institution.  Such a student will normally 
NOT
 be considered for re-admission.

Students with Academic Problems under the following conditions will be dismissed by the University on academic grounds:
a student taking 
12 units or more
 counting towards GPA in a semester and whose semester GPA is 
below 1.67
 for 
two
 consecutive semesters; or
a student taking 
less than 12 units
 counting towards GPA in a semester and whose semester GPA is 
below 1.67
 for 
three
 consecutive semesters; or
other academic grounds, e.g. a student failing a required course after repeating it 
twice
; or
upon the recommendation of the Department Head/Programme Director.
 
A student who wishes to appeal against such dismissal decisions may do so in writing to the Academic Registrar.  Please refer to 
Appeals against Academic Decisions
 for details.

Honours Classification

                Honours Classification
            
There are 
2
 different systems of classification for degree programmes, one for Honours Degree programmes and the other for General (Non-Honours) Degree programmes.
 
Students enrolled on 
Honours Degree programmes
 will be awarded, upon completion of all requirements, the appropriate Bachelor’s degree with one of the following classifications:
First Class Honours
Second Class (Division I) Honours
Second Class (Division II) Honours
Third Class Honours
Pass
In the case of a Pass, the General Degree with a Pass will be awarded.
 
 
The various classifications are based on the cumulative Grade Point Average (cGPA).  The general guidelines are as follows:

 
cGPA
Honours Classification
3.40–4.00
First Class
3.00–3.39
Second Class (Division I)
2.50–2.99
Second Class (Division II)
2.20–2.49
Third Class
2.00–2.19
Pass
 
 
For programmes which award the General Degree as a distinct pathway option open to students, the cumulative GPA is again employed to determine different designations:
 
cGPA
Designation of Degree
3.40–4.00
Degree with Distinction
2.67–3.39
Degree with Merit
2.00–2.66
Pass Degree
 
 
In all cases of classification/designation of degrees, the cumulative GPAs cited above are indicative.  The Senate reserves the right, upon recommendation of appropriate Department/Programme Management Committee, to make exceptions in the application of these indicative grade point averages.
 
Individual faculties/schools may develop additional or alternative indicators for the award classifications in the programmes.

Scholastic Awards

                Scholastic Awards
            
Student(s) having awarded the 
First Class Honours
 and is the top 
2%
 of graduate(s) (rounding to the nearest integer, but at least one award would be given for each programme/major) with the highest cumulative GPA (cGPA) in the graduating class of their programme/major will be granted the Scholastic Award of that programme/major for that year.
If the percentage of graduates eligible for the award exceeds the limit of 
2% 
because there are graduates with the identical cGPA, all graduates concerned will be granted the Scholastic Award of that programme/major.
For programme of which no graduate is awarded the First Class Honours, the Department/Programme may provide strong justifications on academic grounds to nominate, for consideration of the Senate, the graduate who has attained the highest cGPA in the programme/major and whose cGPA is 
NOT
 less than 3.20 to receive the Scholastic Award.
The Senate reserves the right to refuse granting Scholastic Award to students who have satisfied the above award criteria but have breached the University's standards of conduct.

Complete the 
SEN Registration Form
 .
Submit a professional assessment report issued within 
5 years, 
unless otherwise specified,
 which must contain the diagnostic statement identifying the disability condition and the recommendation on reasonable academic accommodations/adjustments and or/other support services. For details of the documentation criteria, please refer to 
SEN/ Disability Registration Guidelines
 
.
Submit the form and relevant supporting documents in person to the Academic Registry (
Room 701, 7/F Academic and Administration Building)
 
on or before the third week of the semester
.
 
The University will offer appropriate provisions to students who have successfully registered as SEN students. For details of the assistance and support that may be provided, please visit the website at:

Course Pre-registration

                Course Pre-registration
            
All undergraduate students are required to participate in a Course Pre-registration exercise every semester to select elective courses for which they will register.
 

                                                Schedule
                    
The Course Pre-registration exercise is conducted 
twice
 a year (once in each semester) in 
late July
 and 
mid-November
.  The exact dates and the assigned timeslots will be announced via email nearer the time.  Normally, Course Pre-registration results are released in late August and late December each year.
 
Students who fail to complete the Course Pre-registration exercise on time can only complete the course registration during the add/drop period after classes have begun.  However, it should be noted that many courses will be full and thus not available for registration by that time.

                                                Registration Priority
                    
The priority in assigning courses to students is set according to the students' year of study, course types and the academic departments' special instructions, if any.  The priority of different course types is listed as follows:
 
 
Major Required/ Core courses (those 
NOT
 assigned but require to register on their own)
Major electives
University core/GE courses (i.e. GE Distribution/Foundational/Interdisciplinary Thematic courses/GE Capstone)
Free electives

	 
Details of Course Pre-registration exercise are available at 
BUniPort
.

 

                                                Workflow of Course Pre-registration
                    
Undergraduate students are required to participate in a Course Pre-registration exercise every semester to indicate their preferences of elective courses.
The Academic Registry releases class timetable (
2 semesters
) for the following academic year in July.  Students should check the timetable at 
BUniPort
 under Course Information.
Students will be informed via email before the exercise.  Students will be assigned a timeslot for completing the Course Pre-registration exercise.  The assigned timeslot can be checked under the "Pre-registration" page at 
BUniPort
.
The required courses have been assigned to students, including the failed courses.  Students should check and inform the Academic Registry if there is any discrepancy with their record.
During the assigned pre-registration timeslots, students may (i) indicate their preferences of elective courses provided they meet the course requirements with no time clash on their timetable; and/or (ii) change the section of the required course(s) already assigned if there is time clash between the preferred elective course(s) and the required course(s).  Changes of section for required courses (but 
NOT
 the preferences for elective courses) is on a first-come-first-served basis.  Input and modification of course preference must be completed within the timeslot assigned.
The courses will be assigned according to priority.  No guarantee of seats can be made due to limited class quota. 
The priority in assigning courses to students is set according to the students' year of study, course types and the academic departments' special instructions, if any.  The priority of different course types is listed as follows:

	(i)    Major Required/ Core courses (those not assigned but require to register on their own)

	(ii)   Major electives

	(iii)  GE courses (e.g. both GE core and GE distribution requirement)

	(iv)  Free electives

	During the course assignment process, course enrolment record and individual timetable in the BUniport will be temporarily suspended.  An email notification will be sent to students when the results of Course Pre-Registration Exercise are released.  
Students who fail to complete the exercise can only complete the course registration during the course add/drop period.  However, it should be noted that many courses will be full and not available for registration by that time.

Study Load

                Study Load
            
Normally, students are required to register for all courses prescribed on a particular programme, including elective courses, each year.  Study schedules are available in the 
BUniPort
 and the programme document/handbook.
In special circumstances when a student cannot fulfil the graduation requirements within the normal period of study and is granted extension of study, he/she will be classified as “part-time” when registering for 
less than 12 units
 in a semester during the extension period.
Unless prescribed in an approved study plan, a student may 
NOT
 register for 
more than 18 units
 in a semester.  Students who wish to do so must obtain approval from the Department Head/Programme Director and the Academic Registrar during the course add/drop period.  Students who wish to register for more than 
21 units
 must obtain support from the Department Head/Programme Director and apply to the Academic Registrar in writing.  Approval for a study load in excess of 21 units will only be given under exceptional circumstances.
Students placed on academic probation must work out and agree on a study plan with their Department Head/Programme Director.  Normally, this study plan will include a reduced study load according to the following guidelines:

	 
	
(i)
Those with a failure of 
0–6 units
 in the previous semester may be required to take 
NOT
 more than 
12 units
 in the following semester.
(ii)
Those with a failure of more than 
6 units
 in the previous semester may be required to take 
NOT
 more than 
9 units
 in the following semester.
The President and Vice President(s) of the Students’ Union will be allowed to suspend study or reduce their study load to any number of units during their tenure in the Students’ Union, and to extend their study period up to one academic year if they so wish.  In such cases, an appropriate study plan should be drawn up by the student and approved by the Department Head/Programme Director.

                                                Schedule
                    
The Course Pre-registration exercise is conducted in 
mid-July (for Fall semester) and mid-November (for Spring semester)
.  The exact dates will be announced via email nearer the time.
Results of Course Pre-registration are released in 
late August and late December
 each year via the 
BUniPort
.
Failing to complete the Course Pre-registration exercise, students can only complete the course registration during the 
Course Add/Drop period
 after classes have begun.  However, it should be noted that many courses will be full and thus 
NOT
 available for registration by that time.
 

                                                Workflow of Course Pre-registration
                    
Incoming exchange and Extended Study Programme students are required to participate in the Course Pre-registration exercise to indicate their course preference before the commencement of their studies at HKBU.
Students are required to take a minimum of 
12 units
 per semester in order to maintain the full-time study status.  Students are advised to register for 
18 units
 during the Course Pre-registration Exercise as some classes may be cancelled later.
Some courses may have a pre-requisite requirement (i.e. students should have completed course A before they are allowed to take course B).  During the Online Course Pre-Registration, all the pre-requisite requirements are 
WAIVED
.  Students are advised to add the course first.
Each student’s registered course list and the student’s transcript will be sent to the respective academic departments for assessment.  If the academic departments consider that a student has 
NOT
 met the requirement for a particular course, the student will be removed from that course before the final course enrolment results are released at the beginning of a semester.
Students can still adjust the course enrolment in the first 
2 weeks
 of the semester during the Course Add/Drop period.
The course enrolment is subject to the final class schedule as well as the approval of academic departments.  Students must discuss with their home institutions to allow flexibility in the study plan in case some preferred courses cannot be registered.

HKBU Digital Credential System

                HKBU Digital Credential System
            
Through the HKBU Digital Credential System, students may access and share their official transcripts/diplomas with another person/institution such as employer, employment agency, or another educational institution in electronic format.
Electronic transcripts/diplomas directly downloaded from the HKBU Digital Credential System are official and authentic; those received in other ways should be verified through the System to ensure authenticity.
The System supports at this stage transcripts of students approved to graduate since 2020 and diplomas of graduates of 2021 onwards
.  Updates on the scope of services of the System, if available, will be announced via this website.
 
System Functionality 
Electronic 
transcripts
 are released via the System after students are approved by the Senate to graduate.  Electronic 
diplomas
 are available normally on the 'Date of Award to be Printed on Diploma' listed under the 
Diploma Collection Schedule
.
When electronic transcripts/diplomas are available in the HKBU Digital Credential System, 
the graduates concerned will receive a notification email via their HKBU email account
 informing them of the release of the documents.    
The graduates may then login to the HKBU Digital Credential System with their 
SSOid
 to download or share the documents with another person/institution.
To share a document, the graduate just needs to enter the email address of the document recipient (one recipient at a time) in the System.  The System will send an email embedded with a download link to the recipient.
The download link is protected by an access code which is sent to the recipient in a separate email.
The recipient may download the document from the System 
within 30 days
.  After 30 days, the download link will expire.
The recipient may validate the authenticity of the e-document via the System.
Electronic transcripts/diplomas are in Portable Document Format (PDF) viewable with a PDF reader.

Supplementary Exam

                Supplementary Examination
            
The supplementary examination will normally take place during the period of make-up examination and will be administered by the Academic Registry or individual departments.
 
Students who fail a course only due to failure of the end-of-semester examination or year examination may be allowed to sit for supplementary examination, as may be 
recommended by the Programme
 in consultation with the course instructor.
 
Students, including final year students, are allowed to take supplementary examination for a maximum of 
1 course
 per semester and 
Grade D is the maximum grade
 for the course after supplementary examination.
 
For final year students, recommendation to take supplementary examination for any failed course in Semester 2 should be approved by the Senate.
 
Students who are recommended for a supplementary examination for a course will be notified by email.  Supplementary examination timetable for Semesters 1 and 2 will be announced via the 
BUniPort
 ("My Examination Timetable") about 
1 week
 before the supplementary examination period stated on the Academic Calendar.  Students should login 
BUniPort
 to check the details themselves.

Courses in this category aim to enhance students’ competence and interest in reading, writing, speaking and Chinese language knowledge, and to foster the linguistic proficiency and communication skills that are essential to their study and future careers. After completing a course in this category, students should be able to:
 
Identify and analyse ungrammatical expressions and produce concise writing pieces;
Comprehend, interpret, analyse and evaluate the main ideas and writing techniques of selected expository and argumentative masterpieces;
Write a concise and well-structured expository essay that contains concrete, relevant and sufficient details so as to provide in-depth analysis and explanations;

The category provides a blueprint for how students can live an active and healthy life. This category is created to offer different kinds of courses, which involve physical activities to promote students’ physical or psychological and mental health. The overarching curricular outcomes of this category are to purposefully engage students in physical activities by developing knowledge of, skills for, and attitude towards an active and healthy lifestyle. Specifically, students in various courses in this category will learn to:
 
Appreciate and value the benefits of healthy lifestyle practices by relating them to a healthy body from multiple perspectives;
Appreciate the importance of making health-enhancing decisions in daily living by adopting healthy habits such as intake of healthy foods, regular exercise, and managing life’s stresses through self-reflection, and mediation;

Learning Pathways

                Learning Pathways
            
The University adopts innovative and flexible programme design to allow students to complete their study through different pathways.  First year undergraduate students 
admitted from Academic Year 2022/23 onwards
 may choose a learning pathway to suit their needs, aptitudes and aspirations.
 
 
Structured Pathway
For students who want to 
enter specific professions or industries or have an in-depth training in a discipline
.  To be in line with the future needs of the society, the curricula under this pathway will be constantly refreshed.
 
 
Transdisciplinary Pathway
For students who 
seek greater flexibility for the future and desire programmes spanning more than one disciplinary area
.  The transdisciplinary degrees enable advancement of learning beyond professional silos, involve heavier emphasis on collaboration across disciplines, build competencies, draw on HKBU research strengths, and are shaped by the input of industry partners.
 
 
Personalised Pathway
For students who are more 
mission or goal-oriented, seek to architect their own learning experiences, and push the boundaries to address the problems of tomorrow
.  Under this pathway, the Future-focused programme allows the greatest flexibility in terms of the fields of study and the learning methods.  It offers a range of experiential and immersive learning methods structured around authentic problems and challenges to help construct meaningful connections.  Students address these problems together with students from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds.

Academic Advising

                Academic Advising
            
At university, a high degree of independence and maturity is expected from students. University learning requires you to learn and complete assignments independently, plan your workload, meet deadlines, and organize your time. This level of self-management can be a challenge at first, but most students thrive on it.
 
To help you succeed in your study, faculty and offices will make every effort to guide you towards completion of all requirements. In addition to the Faculty/School-based orientations for new students, students can approach the assigned academic advisor(s) for academic advice.
 
All students in their first year in the University are required to meet with their academic advisor at least once per semester. From Year 2 of study onwards, you are encouraged to schedule meetings with advisors as needed to discuss your academic progress.
 
In any year, you 
are required
 to meet with your advisor under the following circumstances: 
 
(i) when you declare or change a major;
(ii) following an advisor change;
(iii) when you are placed on academic probation; and
(iv) when you opt out of Transdisciplinary Second Major (TSM)/Second Major (SM).
 
 
There are different types of academic advisors:
 
Faculty/Programme Academic Advising Coordinator – assumes the overall responsibility for coordinating all academic advising activities in the Faculty/programme, works closely with academic advisors to take care of your development during the University study;
Faculty/Programme Academic Advisors – broad-based programme academic advisors help you adjust to university life, choose your majors and plan your study;
Department Academic Advisors (for First-Year-First-Degree Year 1 students in programme-based admission and Year 2 students and above) – advisor at the departmental level help you succeed in your major studies, provide advice on course selection, study planning, career development, and guide your successful transition to the workplace;
TSM/SM academic/teaching staff – provide you with specific information of the TSM/SM and advise you on course selection in the TSM/SM; and
Advisors designated by the Division of Transdisciplinary Undergraduate Programmes – help individualised major students adjust to university life; and advise them on major and course selection and formulation of the study plan.

Exemption/Unit Transfer
Returning Exchange Students

                For returning exchange students
            

                                                General Regulations for Transfer of Units
                    
Normally, a student’s transferred units (units granted at the point of admission and units obtained through exchange programmes) should 
NOT 
exceed half of the total units required for graduation.
Senior Year Entrants
 admitted directly to Year 3 of study 
before 2021/22
 may receive an additional unit transfer of 
up to 16 units
 if they subsequently participate in an exchange programme.
Senior Year Entrants
 admitted directly to Year 3 of study 
in 2021/22 and thereafter
 may receive transferred units of 
up to two-thirds of the unit requirement
 if they subsequently participate in an exchange programme.
Students completing any exchange activities after graduation are 
NOT
 eligible to apply for transfer of units.
Units transferred from other institutions will be excluded from the calculation of Grade Point Average (GPA).
The University reserves the right to refuse granting units for courses with grades below the equivalence of grade C in the University grading system, and for courses which are not at post-secondary level.
Notes:
 
No dropping of course / course withdrawal arising from approval of unit transfer will be allowed after the course withdrawal deadline, which is normally four weeks before the semester examination. As such, students should complete the unit transfer procedures by submitting the verified official transcript to the Academic Registry as early as possible.
Students who have successfully completed the Extended Study Programme at 
Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University
 (
BNBU
) / 
self-arranged overseas studies
 should submit the application form for transfer of units instead of submitting application via the Online Form system on BUniPort. Please click 
HERE
 for the details.

                                                Application Procedures
                    
Students who wish to apply for transfer of units after exchange should submit application to the Academic Registry via the Online Form system on 
BUniPort
 (Studies > My e-Application > Online Form) for consideration and recommendation by the Academy Director/Department Head/Programme Director or General Education Office. The final approval rests with the Academic Registrar.
Students can apply for unit transfer of the following type of courses after exchange:
	
 
Type of courses
Examples
Transfer Type (I)
Courses with a specific HKBU course
BUSIXXXX, SOCIXXXX,  VARTXXXX, etc.
Transfer Type (II)
Courses without a specific HKBU course
Any free elective course which counts towards fulfilment of Free Elective course requirement.
Transfer Type (III)
Courses which count towards fulfilment of University Core / General Education requirement
GFHC, GFQR, GFVM, GT, GCAP, etc.
Students who wish to apply for unit transfer of 
different transfer types
 should submit 
separate application forms
 for consideration and approval.
Supporting documents which include official transcript 
verified by the International Office**
, course outlines/syllabuses and course assessment methods should be uploaded in your application.
If the application is approved, you will be exempted from taking such course(s) and 
no course replacement is required.
** Applications with unverified student transcript will not be processed.  Students may be subject to spot checks to produce their original official transcript for verification.  Any alterations to the official/verified copy will be subject to disciplinary action.

                                                Q&A for TSMs/SMs
                    
How and when can I apply for a Transdisciplinary Second Major (TSM) or a Second Major (SM)?

	Ans: There will be a formal declaration procedure for students to make a declaration in the second semester of their second year of studies.
I am a student admitted to senior years (i.e. direct entry to Year 2 or Year 3) in the 2024/25 academic year. Am I eligible to apply for a TSM or SM?

	Ans: Students admitted to senior years and dual/double/combined/transdisciplinary degree programmes are not eligible.
What is the curriculum structure of an FM with a TSM or SM?

	Ans: The unit requirement for a TSM and SM is 42 units, taken with an FM of 48 units. Students taking an FM with a TSM or SM will be required to take a total of 134 units for graduation (6 units more than the regular graduation requirement for students taking a single disciplinary major).
Can I choose to take my honours project from the TSM?

	Ans: No. Each student is required to complete only one honours project, which must be taken from the FM.
How many units of double counting are allowed between my FM and TSM or SM? Are there any restrictions on the courses that can be double counted?

	Ans: Up to 9 units of double counting are allowed between the FM and TSM or SM. However, higher-level courses (3xxx and above) cannot be double-counted.
What is the difference between a minor and TSM / SM?

	Ans: A minor only consists of a minimum of 15 units, whereas a TSM or SM consists of 42 units. In addition, although both a minor and a TSM or SM will be shown on the transcript, only the TSM or SM will be shown on the diploma.
Can I declare more than one TSM/SM with preferences?

	Ans: No. Students can only declare one TSM or SM.
Can I change from one TSM or SM to another after declaring for a TSM or SM?

	Ans: Once declared, students are not allowed to change their TSM or SM.
Can I opt out of a TSM or SM and switch back to my single major after declaring for a TSM or SM?

	Ans: Students may, with the approval of the TSM Coordinator and the programme director of the student's programme, opt out and switch back to the single disciplinary major after declaring for a TSM or SM by the end of their third year of study. Students should seek the advice of the academic adviser before the decision is made.
Can I declare another TSM or SM after opting out of a TSM or SM?

	Ans: No, once opted out, students are not allowed to declare for another TSM or SM.
I cannot complete the FM and TSM or SM requirements in four years, can I be allowed to extend my study period?

	Ans: Requiring additional time to complete the FM and TSM or SM is not considered a valid reason for granting a concessional year of study.
Will my study of TSM or SM be shown on the transcript and graduation diploma?

	Ans: Yes, the study of a TSM or SM will be shown on the transcript and graduation diploma of the student.

Leave of Absence/Suspension of Studies/Withdrawal of Studies
Leave of Absence

                Leave of Absence
            
2021/22 academic year and before 
 
Leave of Absence
 refers to the leave granted to students due to participation in internship/placement or self-arranged overseas studies.   
Suspension of Studies
 refers to the leave initiated by students due to health problems, urgent family affairs or other circumstances as deemed acceptable by the student's Department/Programme.
2022/23 academic year onwards
A new set of regulations has been implemented:
 
Leave of Absence 
refers to all types of leave initiated by and granted to students for reasons such as internship/placement, self-arranged overseas studies, health problems or urgent family affairs.   
Suspension of Studies 
refers only to the disciplinary sanction imposed on students by the University. 
Students may be permitted to take 
leave of absence
 from their studies in cases of 
health problems
, 
study-related placement
, or 
other circumstances as deemed acceptable
 by the student’s programme. 
Students who wish to take leave of absence should apply via 
BUniPort
 by the deadline stipulated by the Academic Registry:

	 
	
For health problems or other circumstances as deemed acceptable by the student's Department/Programme
Application should be made 
at least 4 weeks before
 the commencement of the semester 
final examination
.
 
For study-related internship/placement
Application should be made in advance 
before the start of the leave period
.
The Academic Registrar will consult with the Department Head/Programme Director before making a decision.  A leave period up to 2 semesters may be granted for each application approved.  For further extension of the leave period, a new application has to be made before the expiration of the leave period.
The Academic Registry will inform the student of the application result.  If the application is approved, the student will be notified of the approved period of leave of absence.
Students must apply for 
Resumption of Studies
 via the 
BUniPort
 
at least ONE MONTH before expiration of the approved leave period
.  Otherwise, the student will be considered as having unofficially withdrawn from the University.  For leave of absence approved on medical grounds, a medical document certifying that the student is fit for study must be attached with the application for resumption of studies.

Withdrawal of Studies

                Withdrawal of Studies
            
Students who wish to leave the University before graduation must apply for 
official withdrawal
 via 
BUniPort
. 
A student who leaves the University without following the proper procedures will be considered as having unofficially withdrawn.  No official documents will be issued to such a student, and he/she will not be re-admitted under this status.
After the online application is submitted, it will be forwarded to the student’s major department office, Library, Office of Student Affairs, Finance Office and Academic Registry for clearance.  
Students should return the University Gown, given to them at the time of admission, if any, to the Office of Student Affairs for clearance.
Students are expected to attend classes and/or sit for any examinations before the application is approved.
The online application for official withdrawal should be submitted before the 
course withdrawal deadline
, which is normally four weeks before the semester examination. The course(s) enrolled in that semester will be assigned a "W" grade, which is 
NOT
 included in GPA calculations.
