=== HKBU Library FAQ ===
Q. Are there any past examination papers or other materials in the Library that can help me prepare for the Common Recruitment Examination (CRE)?
Ans: Please note that the HKSAR Government does not release the past papers of the Common Recruitment Examination (CRE), and therefore none are available in the Library. However, the Library does have several relevant study guides in its collection, which can be browsed here.

You can also find example questions on the Civil Service Bureau's website at http://www.csb.gov.hk/english/recruit/cre/949.html

Additionally, the CRE is similar in level to the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT). Study guides for these tests may also help you to prepare. You can view our holdings by or performing a keyword search in OneSearch for "GMAT" or "GRE".

Q. How many books can I borrow from the Library, and for how long?
Ans: Books in the General Collection can be borrowed for 20 weeks. The number of renewals is unlimited, so you can keep the book as long as you need it, or until it is recalled to the Library by another borrower.

Your loan quota (i.e. the number of items you can borrow) depends on the type of users you are. For example, if you are an undergraduate student, you can borrow up to 200 items at a time. 

Check out our Loan Quota Table to find out more.  

Q. How can I use Turnitin to check my assignment/paper?
Ans: At HKBU, Turnitin is integrated into the University's e-learning platform (HKBU Moodle).

Your professor needs to setup a Turnitin Assignment before you can use it in the process of submitting your assignment. Depending on how your professor has set up the assignment, you may be able to review the similarity report and revise your paper before final submission.

Additionally, the Library maintains a practice Turnitin Assignment on a designated course site on HKBU Moodle and SCE Moodle for students that would like to check their academic work before submitting to department.


You can also refer to the BU eLearning page for additional information ( Additional Digital Learning & Teaching Tools > Anti-Plagiarism >Turnitin).

For further assistance, you can contact the BU eLearning Support Team:

	- 3411-7899 (Technical)
	- 3411-5348 (Pedagogical)
	- buelearn@hkbu.edu.hk (HKBU)
	- scemoodle@hkbu.edu.hk (SCE)

Q. Why is it so cold in the Library?
Ans: The temperature in the Library is set at a level that assures the safe preservation of Library material. Conditions of warmth and humidity encourage the growth of mold and the proliferation of pests such as insects and worms, which can have potentially disastrous consequences for the Library. There have been cases in local libraries where tens of thousands of books have been destroyed in mold outbreaks. 

The Library cares greatly about our users' well-being and the environment, but we must try to strike a balance between the comfort of our users and the protection of our collections. 

Q. Do I need to include a retrieval date for all of the sources that I find online?
Ans: This is a common question, and the answer is very different depending on the citation style that you are using:

APA Style

According to the APA guidelines, you normally do not need to mention when you accessed a source in your citations. Include the retrieval date only when you are citing a source that is updated frequently, for example a Wikipedia article (although really you shouldn't be citing Wikipedia!). 

When to Include Retrieval Dates for Online Sources
   This article from the APA Style Blog gives more information on when to include retrieval dates.

MLA Style

The eighth edition of the MLA Handbook does not require that you include a date of access—the date on which you consulted a work—when you cite an online work from a reliable, stable source. However, you may include an access date as an optional element if it will be useful to others. (See the MLA Handbook, eighth edition, pp. 50–53, for more on optional elements.)


Chicago Style

The Chicago Manual takes a similar approach to APA Style, noting that the value of the access date is of limited value as it cannot be verified by the reader. Chicago does not require the access date "unless no date of publication or revision can be determined from the source" (section 14.7 of the Manual). 

Q. Can I go to other academic libraries in Hong Kong? If so, is there any fee?
Ans: Libraries of other UGC-funded institutions


The libraries of the eight UGC-funded institutions collaboratively offer the JULAC (Joint University Librarians Advisory Committee) Card to eligible users. The JULAC card allows the holder to enter the libraries of the participating institutions.

Faculty and postgraduate students

The JULAC Card offered to eligible faculty and postgraduates also allows the holder to borrow items from the circulating collections of other JULAC libraries.

JULAC Card applications are free of charge for HKBU teaching faculty, administrative-equivalent staff, and eligible postgraduate students. The card will expire at the end of your contract / expected period of study.

Undergraduate Students

UGC-funded undergraduates are eligible to apply for a JULAC Reader Card that allows access but not borrowing. Please note that a HK$50 administrative charge is applicable annually for EACH library that you visit.

Application

Eligible users may apply for a JULAC card online.

E-Resources

Please note that the JULAC Card only allows physical access to other UGC libraries. While you can use their public workstations to access their e-resources on-site, you will not be able to remotely access their e-resources.

 

Non-UGC Libraries

Some Reader cards allowing access to certain non-UGC libraries are available on request. Restrictions may apply. Please visit User Services Counter of Main Library (Level 3) for details.

=== Examinations ===
Supplementary Examination:
The supplementary examination will normally take place during the period of make-up examination and will be administered by the Academic Registry or individual departments.

Students who fail a course only due to failure of the end-of-semester or year examination may be allowed to sit for a supplementary examination, as recommended by the Programme in consultation with the course instructor.

Students, including final year students, are allowed to take supplementary examination for a maximum of 1 course per semester and Grade D is the maximum grade for the course after supplementary examination.

For final year students, recommendation to take supplementary examination for any failed course in Semester 2 should be approved by the Senate.

Students who are recommended for a supplementary examination for a course will be notified by email.  Supplementary examination timetable for Semesters 1 and 2 will be announced via the BUniPort ("My Examination Timetable") about 1 week before the supplementary examination period stated on the Academic Calendar.  Students should login BUniPort to check the details themselves.

=== Honours Classification ===
There are 2 different systems of classification for degree programmes, one for Honours Degree programmes and the other for General (Non-Honours) Degree programmes.

Students enrolled on Honours Degree programmes will be awarded, upon completion of all requirements, the appropriate Bachelor’s degree with one of the following classifications:
1. First Class Honours
2. Second Class (Division I) Honours
3. Second Class (Division II) Honours
4. Third Class Honours
5. Pass
In the case of a Pass, the General Degree with a Pass will be awarded.


The various classifications are based on the cumulative Grade Point Average (cGPA).  The general guidelines are as follows:
cGPA 3.40–4.00: First Class
cGPA 3.00–3.39: Second Class (Division I)
cGPA 2.50–2.99: Second Class (Division II)
cGPA 2.20–2.49: Third Class
cGPA 2.00–2.19: Pass


For programmes which award the General Degree as a distinct pathway option open to students, the cumulative GPA is again employed to determine different designations:
cGPA 3.40–4.00: Degree with Distinction
cGPA 2.67–3.39: Degree with Merit
cGPA 2.00–2.66: Pass Degree

(In all cases of classification/designation of degrees, the cumulative GPAs cited above are indicative.  The Senate reserves the right, upon recommendation of appropriate Department/Programme Management Committee, to make exceptions in the application of these indicative grade point averages.

Individual faculties/schools may develop additional or alternative indicators for the award classifications in the programmes.)
